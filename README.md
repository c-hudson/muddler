This screenshot shows the two interfaces of muddler. In the foreground is muddler running in a terminal window. The background window is firefox connected to the same muddler session via websockets. Both are interactive and can show the same or different worlds.

# muddler

   A perl based mudding reminiscent of TinyFugue with a few twists. 

# Features
```
   o Console support - Mudding via your favorite terminal
   o World editor for editing existing worlds or creating new ones.
   o websocket support - Think mudding via your browser
        dark / light theme / mobile interface supported
   o Tinyfugue like command support.
   o SSL support when connect to worlds or via the browser
   o 256 color, UTF8, fansi, latin encoding support 
   o Connect to multiple worlds at the same time
   o More / pausing output control by tab character
   o History buffer via page up/down or /recall
   o keep-a-live to prevent disconnects
   o Activity notifications
   o /update pulls the most current version of muddler from github
     and loads it without restarting (usually).
   o Spell checking
       Mispelled words will be shown as bold in the terminal.
       Suggestions can be listed and cycled through with Esc-Q.
       The web interface will show a red squiggly underline for
       misspelled words (dependant upon browser).
   o Multiple Window Support - Fire up multiple browser windows or terminals
       as needed. Each window has its own focus independant of other windows.
   o Muddler will work if any optional perl modules are not installed.

```
# muddler goals
```
   o Go for Simplicity.
   o Allow users to switch between computers with ease. The main muddler
     process still needs to run a particular server but viewing can be
     switched from computer to computer.
   o Make a rich and full featured web interface
   o Support a "language" either tinyfugue like or maybe mush?
     (mush is just an easy answer since i've already written a mush in perl)
```
# Installation
```
   The below install steps are for a Linux system. Please see the specialized
   instructions for specific environment included in the respository.

   a. download muddler script
   b. chmod u+x muddler
   c. Install required perl modules manually. Muddler will tell you wich
      modules are missing.

         or 

      ./muddler --install

         This will install missing modules and/or install the modules from
         cpan. Currently this only works on linux systems supporting apt.

   d. ./muddler <options>

   Options:
      --noconsole        : disable the text based console and enable the
                           web/websocket server.
      --password         : specify the password for the websocket interface.
      --port             : specify the port for the web server. The websocket
                           server will be one port number higher.
      --remote=host:port : Specify the remote muddler websocket host/port
                           to connect to.
```
# Quick Start
   
```
   Basic Commands:
      /editor <world>
         Modify the a world's connection details via a "world editor" for a
         new or existing one.
      /world <world>
         Open a new connection to a defined world (in the world editor) or
         switch to that world if the world connection has already been
         established. Switching between connections can be done with
         this command or using the up/down arrow keys or escape-w.
      /help [<command>]
         Lists all commands or provides help on an individual command.
      /quit
         Had enough, quit muddler.
      /set encode = fansi | utf8 | latin
         Enable either fansi, utf8, or latin encoding for the current world.

   Web Commands:
      /web
         Show the status variables for the web server
      /web [on|off]
         Turn the web interace "on" or "off". Default is off.
      /set cert = <file>
         Specify your public certificate file for https.
      /set key = <file>
         Specify your private key file for https [non-self signed required]
      /set password = <password>
         Sets the password that must be entered when connecting vai the web.
      /set port = <port>
         This command sets the port that muddler will use when you connect
         to muddler via your browser. Just type in http://localhost:<port>
         to connect. The default port is port 9000.

         Note: If you plan to connect outside your network to muddler, the
               program uses <port> for web traffic and <port> + 1 for web-
               sockets. i.e. /port 9000 would use ports 9000 and 9001.

   Command Line:
      ./muddler <options>

          --noconsole     : disable the text based console and enable the
                            web/websocket server.
          --password      : specify the password for the websocket interface.
          --port          : specify the port for the web server. The websocket
                            server will be one port number higher.
   Saving stuff:
      muddler saves your data automatically. This is only pointed out because
      programs like TinyFugue require you to issue a command.

# TinyFugue info/differences
```
   If you wish to use your TinyFugue world file, just rename it to ~/.tfworlds.
   This file will be read on startup as long as there is not a .muddler file
   to read. The TinyFugue world file will not be modified by muddler.

   Saving stuff? TinyFugue requires you to do a /saveworld as needed.
   Muddler automatically saves data as needed to its .muddler file.
